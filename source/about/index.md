Hello, welcome to my homepage. My name is 胡修涵 (Hu Xiuhan, family name first). You can also call me Chris. As you can see, my nickname is SQRH on the Internet, which is an alias for the abbreviation of my real name (HXH).

I define myself as a rubyist, a technology enthusiast and a curious observer. I believe the development of the computer and the cybers are positive to human beings, and programmers should be proud of coding as poets satisified by poeming.

I am a undergraduate from CIS, Peking University, and my high school is Yali High School in Changsha, Hunan.

If you want to contact me, please have a look at [Github](https://github.com/huxiuhan), [RenRen](http://www.renren.com/huxiuhan), or send an email to [huxiuhan@gmail.com](mailto:huxiuhan@gmail.com)

An unofficial aboutme page is avalaible [here](/about/unofficial)
